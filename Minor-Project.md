# Used Cars Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using a machine learning approach. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and used to train a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as the car's age, kilometers driven, fuel type, and city. The project also includes data visualizations and model evaluation metrics.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict the price of used cars based on the following features:

- **Year of manufacture**
- **Kilometers driven**
- **Fuel type**
- **Car city**

### The workflow involves:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Model training using **Random Forest Regressor**
- Model evaluation using metrics like:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **RÂ² score**
- Visualization of:
  - Actual vs predicted prices
  - Feature importance

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project contains information about used cars. Below is a description of the dataset:

- **File Format**: CSV
- **Columns**: The dataset includes features like:
  - `car_price_in_rupees`
  - `year_of_manufacture`
  - `kms_driven`
  - `fuel_type`
  - `city`
- **Source**: A local dataset (you can replace this with a link to your dataset if hosted online).

### Data Cleaning:
- Missing values are filled with:
  - Mean for numerical columns
  - Mode for categorical columns
- **Outliers** are removed using Z-scores.
- **Categorical variables** are one-hot encoded.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/used-car-price-prediction.git
cd used-car-price-prediction

Results & Visualizations
