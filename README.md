🎯 Project Objectives
A brief overview of the projects and their objectives:

🚗 Used Cars Price Prediction: Build a model to predict used car prices based on key features like brand, model, year, mileage, and more.

🛒 Customer Segmentation: Analyze purchasing behavior using clustering techniques to segment customers for targeted marketing.

📊 Dataset Information
🚗 Used Cars Prices Dataset

📌 Source: Kaggle Used Cars Dataset
📂 Format: CSV with numerical and categorical features.
🔧 Preprocessing: Missing value handling, encoding categorical data, feature scaling.
🛍 Customer Transactions Dataset

📌 Source: Internal data.
📂 Format: CSV with CustomerID, PurchaseAmount, PurchaseDate, etc.
🔧 Preprocessing: Aggregating purchase data, extracting temporal features.
🛠️ Methodology
🚗 Used Cars Price Prediction:

Applied Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models to predict used car prices based on various features like car brand, model, year, mileage, and more.
Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Used Feature Importance techniques to identify the key factors influencing car prices.
🛒 Customer Segmentation:

Used K-Means Clustering to group customers based on spending habits.
Determined optimal clusters using the Elbow Method.
⚙️ Installation & Dependencies
Set up the environment with the following steps:

git clone https://github.com/BVPKARTHIKEYA/A.N.D-DATASCIENCE-AND-ML-INTERNSHIP.git
cd A.N.D-DATASCIENCE-AND-ML-INTERNSHIP

python3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use \venv\\Scripts\\activate\
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ How to Run
Follow these steps to run the projects:

🚗 Used Cars Price Prediction

cd used_cars_price_prediction
python predict.py
Predictions will be saved in the output folder.
🛒 Customer Segmentation

cd customer_segmentation

jupyter notebook segmentation_analysis.ipynb
