## 🎯 Project Objectives

This internship consists of two major projects aimed at solving practical business problems:

### 🚗 Used Cars Price Prediction
Build a robust machine learning model to predict used car prices based on various features such as:
- Car make, model, and year
- Mileage and condition
- Engine specifications
- Location and market demand

**Goal:** Help buyers and sellers make informed decisions with accurate price estimations.

### 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
Develop an intelligent fraud detection system to identify fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time:
- Analyze transaction patterns
- Detect anomalies and suspicious activities
- Minimize false positives while maximizing fraud detection

**Goal:** Protect customers and financial institutions from fraudulent transactions.
